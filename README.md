# fictional-pizzeria
This project implements a chat bot for a fictional pizzeria that allows customers to place orders based on a predefined menu. The bot calculates the total amount for the order and communicates it back to the customer. If an item is not available, the bot informs the customer and prompts them to choose from the available options.
